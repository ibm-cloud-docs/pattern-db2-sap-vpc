{: troubleshoot}
{: support} 



You try to create more than one instance in your Lite account, but you can't create more.
{: shortdesc}






Description of the troubleshooting entry symptom. For example: You receive the following error message when you try to create a new Lite plan instance:
{: tsSymptoms}

> message-id.0001E: Unable to provision new Lite instance

Description of the troubleshooting entry cause. For example: There's a limit of one instance per Lite plan to ensure that these plans stay free. For more information about Lite account features, see [Lite account](link).
{: tsCauses}

Description of the troubleshooting entry resolution. For example: You can create more instances of the service by selecting one of the billable service plans, which are available in the billable accounts. To upgrade to a billable account from the console, go to **Manage > Account**, and select **Account settings**.
{: tsResolve}

If you don't want to upgrade from a Lite account and are no longer using your existing Lite service instance, you can delete the existing Lite plan instance from the dashboard and then create a new instance.
