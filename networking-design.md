This pattern is built within an IBM Cloud Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) environment. For more details on IBM Cloud VPC, see:

[IBM CloudÂ® Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Infrastructure environment introduction](/docs/sap?topic=sap-vpc-env-introduction).

[About networking](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-networking-for-vpc).
