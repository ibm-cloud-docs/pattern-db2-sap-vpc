# Storage design
{: #storage-design}

This pattern is built within an IBM Cloud Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) environment. For more details on IBM Cloud VPC, see:

[IBM CloudÂ® Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Infrastructure environment introduction](/docs/sap?topic=sap-vpc-env-introduction).

Block storage is provided with your virtual servers and uses input/output operations per second (IOPS) to determine storage needs. It is ideal for storage-intensive applications with high I/O needs, such as an OS, and database and application software. This option is the perfect companion for SAP HANA workloads.

It is recommended that the Boot Volume of the VSI is NOT used to provide block storage for both Db2 and SAP. This should be added as separate volumes.{: note}

All Block storage is selected based on capacity (GB) and performance (IOPS) measurements and is required to meet a specific SAP Workload.

IOPS values are measured based on 16 KB blocksize with a 50-50 read/write mix. To achieve a maximum I/O throughput, it's advisable to look at the tier and custom profiles available for storage and find the optimal combination of blocksize and IOPS.

Storage volumes differ in performance, depending on their IOPS tier. You can select among 3, 5, and 10 IOPS/GB (see [Tiered IOPS profiles](docs/vpc?topic=vpc-block-storage-profiles&interface=ui#tiers)). You can also select a [custom value](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-block-storage-profiles&interface=ui#custom) (in GB and IOPS) that is based on the blocksize of the storage.

If you need more than the initially provisioned storage in your server, you can attach extra volumes to a it later. Contact [IBM Cloud Support](/docs/account?topic=account-using-avatar#getting-support) for extension options if the attached storage is insufficient for your workload.



Shared Storage

Block storage can be detached and attached to other servers at any time, but, only to one server at the same time.

No shared storage for servers is available in VPC at time of writing.
